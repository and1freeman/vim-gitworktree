*gitworktree.txt* Git worktree wrapper for vim.

INTRODUCTION                                     *gitworktree*

This simple wrapper is created to manage git worktrees more effectively.
Besides having git-worktree functionality, it also provides ways to use tmux
to control worktrees in different windows.

COMMANDS

                                                 *:Gwt*
:Gwt                    With no arguments, show list of workrees associated
                        with current git repository.

                                                 *:Gwt_add*
:Gwt add {args}         Add a git worktree. {args} are just anything
                        git-worktree can accept.

                                                 *:Gwt_remove*
:Gwt remove {worktree}  Remove {worktree}. {worktree} may be a branch name, as
                        as well as a path (for worktrees with detached HEAD).

                                                 *:Gwt_load*
:Gwt load {worktree}    Load {worktree}. {worktree} is a branch name or path
                        (see |:Gwt_remove|). At the moment, it is possible to
                        load worktree inside current vim process or inside new
                        tmux window.
